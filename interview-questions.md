# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is a comparison statement that will be used to determin if the data you are comparing is true or false. If it is true it will execute the block of code given in the statement. if it is false it will move to a new statement until it can execute the code provided when it renders true or just exit the conditional statement all together. These are statements such as if, if else, else, or switch.

  Researched answer: A conditional statement is making a decision about a specific evaluation and them performing some kind of an action on the block of code inside parethesis. An conditional must have an if statement, but can also include else if, and/or else.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a version control program that allows you to update your code through the terminal. It can be used so others may clone it, branch it and then update their own branch which you can later merge into your own code if it is ready to add to the main branch. This is useful in a development team when you have members working on different issues that you can eventualy merge on the deployment ready main branch of the program. Github is designed to host and manage your git repositories.

  Researched answer: git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of you source code history. Github is a cloud based service that hosts and lets you work with you repositories.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The operators used to compare data in statements will return true or false. These may be and(&&), or(||), not equal to(!==), equal to(==), strictly equal to, which ensure the value is the proper data type and value, greater than(>), less than(<), greater thann or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to(<=). These will compare sets of data. If the statement returns true then the designated block of code will execute and exit or continue. If it returns false the compiler will move on to the next conditional statement or exit the program.

  Researched answer: The javascript values that will return a boolean value are AND, OR, and the NOT operators. These will evaluate two sets of information and return either true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a place holder in a datastructures that allow you to access certain stored values at each position. This will help you change certain data in the structure or access only certain elements in the structure to use in your program. A value is the element that you store in a variable or in the data structures that you are using the indexes to access. 

  Researched answer: An Index is a read only property. This element contains the the position of data within an element. A value can be a character, a string, a number, whitespace, booleans. It is what is held at that current index and is accessed when accessing the index.



4. What is iteration? 

  Your answer: An iteration is what happens every time a block of code executes. This is especially useful in loops when you set the number of times a loop executes until the program is done running the block of code. This happens in loops, functions which may have loops and conditional statements in the function. The conditional statement may continue running untill it finds the correct condition to execute the code and exit.

  Researched answer: An iteration is a block of code that is executed until a specific result is achieved and terminates the loop. Thes can be used to invoke a function multiple times with different sets of data.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is a useful tool in the development process. One team member is the driver while the other is the navigator. The driver is responsible for typing out the code (hands on the keyboard). The navigator is responsible for telling the driver what to type and using another set of eyes to see syntax errors, solving problems that happen while figuring out a problem and looking for more efficient ideas to write the code.

  Researched answer: This is an agile development technique where two people work together on code. One person is the navigator who guides the development process.Then the driver is at the keyboard. This can be done remotely or in person and helps detect errors. The team decide on well defined task at a time as they work. The team rotates roles which helps keep developers alert and engaged. Two programmers with matched skills can also use the unstructured method. It is unstructured and hard to organize remotely. Their is the ping pong style which allow one to write a test and the next to pass the test.




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions perform actions on other functions. To be considered a Higher order function must take one or more functions as an argument or return a function as a result.

2. Jest: Jest is an open source JS testing frame work. It is used majorly to test react and react native projects. 

3. Objects: Objects are groups of variables and functions. They are stored in key value pairs and can be accessed using dot or bracket notation. You can access, add and update data in an object.

4. Method: This is a property that contains a function definition. Methods can be used to access information that are stored in objects. You can apply methods using dot or bracket notation.

5. Classes: Classes are templates for creating objects. These groups of code hold multiple objects and allow you to manipulate variables and functions.
